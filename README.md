# FL50B_VFO
This is a cut-down version of TX_VFO for providing DDS VFO facilities for the FL50B transmitter. 

Note that, prior to uploading this sketch to the Nano, an EEPROM Initialiser sketch needs to be run on the target Nano.   It only needs to be run once.  The initialiser script can be found at:
